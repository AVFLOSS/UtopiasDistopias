The next night she stood still, watching only the reflections of the water, the abstract forms of light that are diluted, hitting the concrete, the small waves that pass from one language to another like words that escape, are shared and diluted just like light in water.

The particles float in the nocturnal atmosphere, like fireflies reflected in the water from which the machine emerged, high technology underwater that causes tides and storms, but I can't get over that storm, my mind is blocked, absent, time stops.

I have never actually seen fireflies, and since we have moved to Mars it has been difficult to understand how my parents' life on Earth was. I only dream of water, animals and other things I've never seen.

Virtual and sensory simulations allow us to stay sane, but they block us from comparing the very different reality in which we find ourselves.

The art and culture we enjoy is the one created before 2050, when artistic creation was banned because the scarcity of resources did not allow it.

Sometimes I dream of the red deserts that surround me, I enjoy its beauty. I can't tell anyone about these dreams, it would be crazy to say that our world today is more beautiful or at least has a particular beauty with respect to the virtual nostalgia for life on Earth that is transmitted to us in the systems of leisure and contemplation.

Some rebel groups propose the clandestine creation of ships to return to Earth, finally confronting reality with all its consequences.

FIN (or not...)
